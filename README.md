Description: To modify the base of our pyramid we are going to the second option of the ProBuilder horizontal menu in the top of our screeen. With this option we will select the vertices of the lines on the plane and drag them towards the corners. We will do this with all of the lines.
Aftert completing all sides, your plane should look like this:

While pressing Command + D at the same time select all of the borders of the plane and select "Extrude Faces" in the ProBuilder Window. This enlarges the entire plane. Using the scale tool you can change the height of the plane to your preference.

Description: In this step we will create the stairs of our pyramid using a Prism shape. In the ProBuilder Window, select "New Shape", in the Create Shape panel you will find the Prism Shape at the end of th first row of shapes. Make sure that the "Height Cuts" and "Width Cuts" are set to 2 in the Panel Settings. Once you select the Prism, repeat the drag method to create the Prism inside the Scene.

--- Huts Creation ---
Part 4 Creating Huts
4.1 Create Cube using ProBuilder
We will create 2 huts using the ProBuilder Tool to sit on top of the pyramid.

Description: Open the ProBuilder Window and create a "New Shape". In this case we will create a cube. Drag to the size of your preference in width and height for your cube.

4.2 Subdivide Faces

Description: Select every face(side) of your cube and press on "Subdivide Faces" in the ProBuilder Window until you have 16(4x4) squares per face. This will allow us to move squares individually or multiple squares at the same time, which facilitates us in a sense of making our cuts and edits more detailed.

4.3 Creating an opening in the front of our Hut
