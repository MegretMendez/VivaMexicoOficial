Description: In the ProBuilder Window select "New Shape", and a Shape panel with advanced 3D shapes should appear. In this panel select the plane icon. Then with your mouse you can drag to create the plane to your desired measures. Change the "Height Cuts" and 'Width Cuts" to 2 in the Plane Settings. 

Part 3: Mold the plane using ProBuilder Tool

3.1 Modify base of our Pyramid

Description: To modify the base of our pyramid we are going to the second option of the ProBuilder horizontal menu in the top of our screeen. With this option we will select the vertices of the lines on the plane and drag them towards the corners. We will do this with all of the lines.
Aftert completing all sides, your plane should look like this:

--- Huts Creation ---
Part 4 Creating Huts
4.1 Create Cube using ProBuilder
We will create 2 huts using the ProBuilder Tool to sit on top of the pyramid.
![CreateHut](https://github.com/MegretMendez/VivaMexicoOficial/assets/142510070/ddaa4c54-f6fa-4943-ae2a-249d4e14d605)

Description: Select every face(side) of your cube and press on "Subdivide Faces" in the ProBuilder Window until you have 16(4x4) squares per face. This will allow us to move squares individually or multiple squares at the same time, which facilitates us in a sense of making our cuts and edits more detailed.

Storyline: Once a feared Aztec dictator, Xochitl had reveled in his power and opulence, ruling with an iron fist from the summit of his grand pyramid. However, fate had other plans. A swift rebellion led by his closest advisors left him exiled, stripped of his throne and riches. Determined to reclaim his lost glory, Xochitl ventured into the wilderness, where he embarked on a journey of redemption. With the relentless spirit of a conqueror still burning within him, he laid the foundation of his own community, starting with a humble pyramid at its heart. 

Over time, this pyramid became a symbol of hope, unity, and rebirth for the people who had chosen to follow him. Xochitl traded the cruelty of his past for benevolence, and his community flourished under his wise and just leadership. The once-exiled dictator had not only built a new empire but had also discovered the true power of redemption and compassion, forever leaving behind the tyrant he once was.
